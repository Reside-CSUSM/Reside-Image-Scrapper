#IDEA:
    - Bots will collect data for elongated periods of time
    - API endpoints to query the server
    - Server to host and fetch the Cached library


#TODO:
    - Create general search functionality
    - Setup up proper routes
    - Implement Java endpoint
    - Setup data storage

    then:
        - Create more website automations
        - Maybe load balancers
        - Bot controllers
    
    then:
        - Ability to launch individual bots online
        - Ability to cache data online

    then:
        - Need to setup code to use deployed bots to push scrapped 
          data to some storage. 
    
    Once the image server can run smoothly without network clogging
    and long distance delay etc through load balancers, sophisticated routing
    and good and efficient server organization. Then deploying
    specific website automations will become extremely easy. Without having to manage
    routing, and etc for server system. 


    Goal is to be able to create website automations without having to change anything
    in the server system. Need to deeply understand http routing and etc.
